for adding keybindings to byobu edit keybindings.tmux file in ~/.byobu
original keybindings can be found in /usr/share/byobu/keybings/f-keys.tmux
byobu-config will not work when python env is of anaconda, try sudo byobu-config then (if anaconda is installed locally and not for root).

Anaconda: 
Download Anaconda .sh file and install using 'bash file.sh'
Anaconda will be installed only for the present user and with not effects in the root. Installation doesn't requre sudo

During installation if init is selected then anaconda default environment i.e. base will be activated by automatically. 
To avoid auto activation use command 
conda config --set auto_activate_base False
And then activate everytime by using command 'conda activate base'. If there is any custom conda environment then replace the word base with environment name.
When activated to remove the environment name in terminal lines use 
conda config --set changeps1 False
