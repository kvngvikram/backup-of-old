These codes are for the first lab session on 18-01-2019. 
In all these codes the 1D head conduction equation is solved numeracally and compared with analytical solution.

In central difference method numerical solution is always going to diverge from actual solution. To make it converge to actual solution, its difference equation is tweaked.
